# Arduino-codes
This Arduino sketch demonstrates how to read temperature and humidity from a DHT sensor and display the values on the serial monitor. The DHT sensor used in this example is connected to pin 2 of the Arduino board.

Connect the DHT sensor to pin 2 of the Arduino board.
Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Open the Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor) to view temperature and humidity readings.
Ensure the serial monitor is set to a baud rate of 9600.
Notes:

Make sure to install the DHT sensor library in the Arduino IDE before uploading the code.
Adjust DHTPIN and DHTTYPE according to your sensor type and pin connection.
This code is for DHT11 sensor; if you're using a different model, change DHTTYPE accordingly (e.g., DHT22).
Feel free to customize the description and instructions according to your preferences. You can include additional information such as hardware connections, expected output, and troubleshooting tips.
